// Gesture is the base object for gesture recognition, although this object is
// quite generalized to serve as a base for multi-touch gestures, it is suitable
// to implement single-touch and pointer-based gestures (using the special NULL
// EventSequence value for these).
//
// The number of touches that a Gesture need to be recognized is controlled by
// the Gesture:n-points property, if a gesture is keeping track of less or more
// than that number of sequences, it won't check wether the gesture is
// recognized.
//
// As soon as the gesture has the expected number of touches, the gesture will
// run the Gesture::check signal regularly on input events until the gesture is
// recognized, the criteria to consider a gesture as "recognized" is left to
// Gesture subclasses.
//
// A recognized gesture will then emit the following signals:
//
// - Gesture::begin when the gesture is recognized.
//
// - A number of Gesture::update, whenever an input event is processed.
//
// - Gesture::end when the gesture is no longer recognized.
//
//
// Event propagation
//
// In order to receive events, a gesture needs to either set a propagation phase
// through gtk_event_controller_set_propagation_phase(), or feed those manually
// through gtk_event_controller_handle_event().
//
// In the capture phase, events are propagated from the toplevel down to the
// target widget, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget
// get a chance to interact with the event before it reaches the target.
//
// After the capture phase, GTK+ emits the traditional
// Widget::button-press-event, Widget::button-release-event,
// Widget::touch-event, etc signals. Gestures with the GTK_PHASE_TARGET phase
// are fed events from the default Widget::event handlers.
//
// In the bubble phase, events are propagated up from the target widget to the
// toplevel, and gestures that are attached to containers above the widget get a
// chance to interact with events that have not been handled yet.
//
//
// States of a sequence
//
// Whenever input interaction happens, a single event may trigger a cascade of
// Gestures, both across the parents of the widget receiving the event and in
// parallel within an individual widget. It is a responsibility of the widgets
// using those gestures to set the state of touch sequences accordingly in order
// to enable cooperation of gestures around the EventSequences triggering those.
//
// Within a widget, gestures can be grouped through gtk_gesture_group(), grouped
// gestures synchronize the state of sequences, so calling
// gtk_gesture_set_sequence_state() on one will effectively propagate the state
// throughout the group.
//
// By default, all sequences start out in the K_EVENT_SEQUENCE_NONE state,
// sequences in this state trigger the gesture event handler, but event
// propagation will continue unstopped by gestures.
//
// If a sequence enters into the K_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED state, the gesture
// group will effectively ignore the sequence, letting events go unstopped
// through the gesture, but the "slot" will still remain occupied while the
// touch is active.
//
// If a sequence enters in the K_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED state, the gesture group
// will grab all interaction on the sequence, by:
//
// - Setting the same sequence to K_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED on every other gesture
// group within the widget, and every gesture on parent widgets in the
// propagation chain.
//
// - calling Gesture::cancel on every gesture in widgets underneath in the
// propagation chain.
//
// - Stopping event propagation after the gesture group handles the event.
//
// Note: if a sequence is set early to K_EVENT_SEQUENCE_CLAIMED on
// K_TOUCH_BEGIN/K_BUTTON_PRESS (so those events are captured before reaching
// the event widget, this implies K_PHASE_CAPTURE), one similar event will
// emulated if the sequence changes to K_EVENT_SEQUENCE_DENIED. This way event
// coherence is preserved before event propagation is unstopped again.
//
// Sequence states can't be changed freely, see gtk_gesture_set_sequence_state()
// to know about the possible lifetimes of a EventSequence.
//
//
// Touchpad gestures
//
// On the platforms that support it, Gesture will handle transparently touchpad
// gesture events. The only precautions users of Gesture should do to enable
// this support are:
//
// - Enabling GDK_TOUCHPAD_GESTURE_MASK on their Windows
//
// - If the gesture has GTK_PHASE_NONE, ensuring events of type
// GDK_TOUCHPAD_SWIPE and GDK_TOUCHPAD_PINCH are handled by the Gesture.

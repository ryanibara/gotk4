// DeviceManager: in addition to a single pointer and keyboard for user
// interface input, GDK contains support for a variety of input devices,
// including graphics tablets, touchscreens and multiple pointers/keyboards
// interacting simultaneously with the user interface. Such input devices often
// have additional features, such as sub-pixel positioning information and
// additional device-dependent information.
//
// In order to query the device hierarchy and be aware of changes in the device
// hierarchy (such as virtual devices being created or removed, or physical
// devices being plugged or unplugged), GDK provides DeviceManager.
//
// By default, and if the platform supports it, GDK is aware of multiple
// keyboard/pointer pairs and multitouch devices. This behavior can be changed
// by calling gdk_disable_multidevice() before gdk_display_open(). There should
// rarely be a need to do that though, since GDK defaults to a compatibility
// mode in which it will emit just one enter/leave event pair for all devices on
// a window. To enable per-device enter/leave events and other multi-pointer
// interaction features, gdk_window_set_support_multidevice() must be called on
// Windows (or gtk_widget_set_support_multidevice() on widgets). window. See the
// gdk_window_set_support_multidevice() documentation for more information.
//
// On X11, multi-device support is implemented through XInput 2. Unless
// gdk_disable_multidevice() is called, the XInput 2 DeviceManager
// implementation will be used as the input source. Otherwise either the core or
// XInput 1 implementations will be used.
//
// For simple applications that don’t have any special interest in input
// devices, the so-called “client pointer” provides a reasonable approximation
// to a simple setup with a single pointer and keyboard. The device that has
// been set as the client pointer can be accessed via
// gdk_device_manager_get_client_pointer().
//
// Conceptually, in multidevice mode there are 2 device types. Virtual devices
// (or master devices) are represented by the pointer cursors and keyboard foci
// that are seen on the screen. Physical devices (or slave devices) represent
// the hardware that is controlling the virtual devices, and thus have no
// visible cursor on the screen.
//
// Virtual devices are always paired, so there is a keyboard device for every
// pointer device. Associations between devices may be inspected through
// gdk_device_get_associated_device().
//
// There may be several virtual devices, and several physical devices could be
// controlling each of these virtual devices. Physical devices may also be
// “floating”, which means they are not attached to any virtual device.
//

// By default, GDK will automatically listen for events coming from all master
// devices, setting the Device for all events coming from input devices. Events
// containing device information are K_MOTION_NOTIFY, K_BUTTON_PRESS,
// K_2BUTTON_PRESS, K_3BUTTON_PRESS, K_BUTTON_RELEASE, K_SCROLL, K_KEY_PRESS,
// K_KEY_RELEASE, K_ENTER_NOTIFY, K_LEAVE_NOTIFY, K_FOCUS_CHANGE,
// K_PROXIMITY_IN, K_PROXIMITY_OUT, K_DRAG_ENTER, K_DRAG_LEAVE, K_DRAG_MOTION,
// K_DRAG_STATUS, K_DROP_START, K_DROP_FINISHED and K_GRAB_BROKEN. When dealing
// with an event on a master device, it is possible to get the source (slave)
// device that the event originated from via gdk_event_get_source_device().
//
// On a standard session, all physical devices are connected by default to the
// "Virtual Core Pointer/Keyboard" master devices, hence routing all events
// through these. This behavior is only modified by device grabs, where the
// slave device is temporarily detached for as long as the grab is held, and
// more permanently by user modifications to the device hierarchy.
//
// On certain application specific setups, it may make sense to detach a
// physical device from its master pointer, and mapping it to an specific
// window. This can be achieved by the combination of gdk_device_grab() and
// gdk_device_set_mode().
//
// In order to listen for events coming from devices other than a virtual
// device, gdk_window_set_device_events() must be called. Generally, this
// function can be used to modify the event mask for any given device.
//
// Input devices may also provide additional information besides X/Y. For
// example, graphics tablets may also provide pressure and X/Y tilt information.
// This information is device-dependent, and may be queried through
// gdk_device_get_axis(). In multidevice mode, virtual devices will change axes
// in order to always represent the physical device that is routing events
// through it. Whenever the physical device changes, the Device:n-axes property
// will be notified, and gdk_device_list_axes() will return the new device axes.
//
// Devices may also have associated “keys” or macro buttons. Such keys can be
// globally set to map into normal X keyboard events. The mapping is set using
// gdk_device_set_key().
//
// In GTK+ 3.20, a new Seat object has been introduced that supersedes
// DeviceManager and should be preferred in newly written code.

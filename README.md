[![built with nix](https://builtwithnix.org/badge.svg)](https://builtwithnix.org)

A GTK4 bindings generator for Go.

[Package documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/diamondburned/gotk4/pkg) |
[Package examples](https://github.com/diamondburned/gotk4-examples) |
[GIR documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/diamondburned/gotk4/gir) |
[Progress tracker](https://github.com/diamondburned/gotk4/issues/2)

All generated packages are in `pkg/`. The generation code is in `gir/girgen/`.

Examples are put in another repository,
[diamondburned/gotk4-examples](https://github.com/diamondburned/gotk4-examples),
along with instructions on getting started with using these packages. Refer to
its README for more information.

As of the time this README was written, most of `pkg/gtk/v4` and `pkg/gtk/v3`
are ready to be used for most purposes. However, memory leaks and sometimes
crashes may occur in certain parts of the API, while other parts might be
completely missing. In that case, an issue should be opened.
